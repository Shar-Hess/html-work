    <h3>Who were the Thracians?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Thracians were an Indo-European people who lived in the region roughly corresponding to modern-day Bulgaria, parts of Greece, and Turkey, particularly around the Black Sea and Aegean Sea. They were known for their warrior culture and complex religious beliefs.
      </ul>
    <h3>Did the Thracians have a unified emipire?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No, the Thracians did not have a single unified empire. Instead, their territory was divided among various tribes and small kingdoms, such as the Odrysians, the Bessi, and the Getae. These tribes and kingdoms often competed with each other and with external powers.
      </ul>
    <h3>What were some of the notable Thracian states or kingdoms?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the most prominent Thracian states was the Odrysian Kingdom, which achieved significant power under King Sitalkes in the 5th century BCE. The Getae, another notable group, were influential in the northern part of Thrace. The Thracian kingdom of Bithynia, although not strictly Thracian, also played a role in the regionâ€™s history.
      </ul>
    <h3>How did the Thracians interact with neighboring civilizations?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Thracians had complex interactions with neighboring civilizations. They often engaged in trade and alliances with Greek city-states and were sometimes hired as mercenaries. They also faced invasions and conflicts with the Macedonian Empire under Alexander the Great and later with the Roman Republic and Empire.
      </ul>   
    <h3>How did the Roman Empire impact Thracian culture and society?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Under Roman rule, Thracian society was significantly influenced by Roman culture. The Romans established cities, infrastructure, and administrative systems that altered the social and economic structures of the region. However, elements of Thracian culture persisted, particularly in local traditions and religious practices.
      </ul>   
    <h3>What legacy did the Thracians leave behind?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Thracians left a rich cultural and archaeological legacy, including impressive tombs, such as the Kazanlak and Alexandrovo tombs, which provide insights into their art, burial practices, and daily life. Their influence is also reflected in Greek and Roman literature, where Thracian warriors and mercenaries are frequently mentioned.
      </ul> 
    <h3>Are there any surviving Thracian languages or inscriptions?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Thracian language is largely lost to history, but some inscriptions and place names have survived. These provide limited information about the language, which remains poorly understood. Most of what we know about Thracian is derived from external sources and inscriptions found on artifacts and monuments.
      </ul>
